Description: Collection of functions for fitting and interpreting distributed lag interaction models (DLIM). A DLIM regresses a scalar outcome on repeated measures of exposure and allows for modification by a continuous variable. Includes a dlim() function for fitting, predict() function for inference, and plotting functions for visualization. Details on methodology are described in Demateis et al. (2024) <doi:10.1002/env.2843>.
